# Crusader Kings 3 Mod
## Shieldmaidens

WIP

As a Pagan Norse leader, appoint Shieldmaidens to be your champions and commanders. If you get annoyed, relieve them of their duties. 

Based on CK2's Shieldmaiden trait.

Content
* Adds new Shieldmaiden trait for female warriors in the court of a Pagan Norse leader (North Germantic Culture Group [Danish, Norse, Norwegian, and Swedish] and Ásatrú) 
* Appoint them via a new interaction, which gives them the Shieldmaiden trait
* Relieve them of their duties with a new interaction, which removes the Shieldmaiden trait


Features
* Custom trait icon
* Historical
* Vanilla friendly


Roadmap
* Better balance 
* Add AI acceptance modifiers to Shieldmaiden appointment and removal
* Add Events with liege (like CK2)
* Add Events for female warriors that ask to become Shielmaidens
* Make it AI compatible, so they will also have Shieldmaidens
* Make it compatible with all supported languages
* Allow hostile religions leaders who somehow gain Shieldmaidens to remove the trait on interaction? IDK why that'd want to...
