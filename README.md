# Crusader Kings 3 Mod
## Shieldmaidens

WIP 

As a Pagan Norse leader, appoint shieldmaidens to be your champions and commanders. If you get annoyed, relieve them of their duties. 

Based on CK2's Shieldmaiden trait. 

It's my first mod for the game, let me know if you run into any issues or have suggestions. 

TODO: 
* Balance it better 
* Add AI modifiers to appointment and relieving Shieldmaidens
* Add Events for a Shieldmaiden and her Liege 
* Other fun little things
